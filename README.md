## PythonClass

Since the 2021 summer, I have been teaching 2 kids python for an hour every week. This is all the lesson plans and teaching code I have. I learned how to break concepts down so younger kids can understand, and pace myself to help others truly understand complicated topics.


### Organization

There is a jupyter notebook for every week containing all the things I taught in that class. It often contains some new concept or practice problems. Each of these items would have a heading associated with it. Below are some commons headings I would use:
* Lesson: A new topic that we are discussing. The notes underneath describe the main points I brought up.
* Problem: Some problem I asked the kids to solve. I would code these problems myself and show it to them after they finished solving it.
* Example: A piece of code that I showed my students for them to better understand a topic.
* Warm-Up: A few easier problems to start getting warmed up. I don't write code for these problems.
