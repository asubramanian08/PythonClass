    "Introduce new DP concepts:\n",
    "- Purpose of a DP is to break down a problem into subproblems of the same structure\n",
    "    - Each subproblem can be solved independently - it's its own problem\n",
    "    - The solution to the problem is build on the solutions to the subproblems\n",
    "- DP state: Describes one subproblem (Ex: for comparing DNA it is i, j - the indices of the strings)\n",
    "- DP transition: How to go from one state to another (Ex: for comparing DNA it is add, remove, substitute)\n",
    "\n",
    "Review each of the transitions and determine expression for them:\n",
    "- Add: `DP[i][j-1] + 1`\n",
    "- Remove: `DP[i-1][j] + 1`\n",
    "- Substitute: `DP[i-1][j-1] + (arr[i]!=arr[j)`"
