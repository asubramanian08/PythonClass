    "Complete the alpha-beta pruning for the tic-tac-toe. Using only a few lines of code you can significantly speed up the time it takes to find the best move. Specifically, for the first move of tic-tac-toe instead of taking 404.7 milliseconds it took 0.66 milliseconds. This time difference is really important for more complex 2-player games like chess and connect 4."
