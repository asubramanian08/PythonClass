    "# New project: Comparing DNA\n",
    "\n",
    "This week is all about explaining the questions and understanding the solution (no code).\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA comparison question:\n",
    "* Input: two DNA sequences\n",
    "* Output: The number of operations it takes to transform one sequence into the other\n",
    "* Operations: insert, delete, replace\n",
    "* For example \"ACTG\" -> \"AGCGT\" takes 3 operations:\n",
    "    * insert a \"G\" between \"A\" and \"C\" (\"ACTG\" -> \"AGCTG\")\n",
    "    * remove the \"T\" (\"AGCTG\" -> \"AGCG\")\n",
    "    * insert a \"T\" at the end (\"AGCG\" -> \"AGCGT\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "* Brute force: try all possible transformations and pick the one with the least operations\n",
    "* The solution is based on dynamic programming\n",
    "* Create a table where each cell denotes the cost of transforming one substring into another\n",

    "    * Removing: The cost of transforming the substring into the other substring without the last character plus 1\n",
    "    * Changing: The cost of transforming the substring without the last character into the other substring without the last character plus 1 if the last characters are different, 0 otherwise"
